# Chess-game
[![CMake](https://github.com/Mikaelfk/Chess-game/actions/workflows/cmake.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Mikaelfk/Chess-game/actions/workflows/cmake.yml)

This is bad :D


## How to run the application

### Linux
cmake and Qt 6.3.0 or newer is required. If running older Qt version remove ```qt_standard_project_setup()``` from [CMakeLists.txt](CMakeLists.txt) and it *might* work.

Run these commands while in the project folder to run the the application
```
cmake .
make
./Chess
```


### Windows
Good luck :)
